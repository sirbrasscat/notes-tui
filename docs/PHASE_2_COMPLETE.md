# PHASE 2: QUICK CAPTURE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Test Status:** All tests passing

---

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

Phase 2 focused on making the TUI truly useful for quick note capture by implementing fast, keyboard-driven workflows that launch your external editor (vim/nano/etc).

---

## ✅ FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Quick Note Creation (`n` key)
**User Story:** "I want to quickly jot down a thought without choosing templates"

**Implementation:**
- Press `n` → Enter note name → Opens in editor immediately
- Uses default template from config (`general_note.md`)
- Creates note in default category (`personal/`)
- If note exists, opens it instead of erroring
- Fallback to blank file if template missing

**Code Location:** `notes_tui/app.py::action_new_note()`

**Test:**
```bash
./venv/bin/notes-tui
# Press 'n'
# Type: "my-quick-idea"
# Editor opens with template
# Write your thought
# Save and exit
# Note appears in tree view
```

---

### 2. Template-Based Creation (`Shift+N` key)
**User Story:** "Sometimes I need structured notes with specific templates"

**Implementation:**
- Press `N` (Shift+n) → Choose template → Enter name → Opens in editor
- Shows template selection dialog
- Creates note from chosen template
- Opens in editor automatically

**Code Location:** `notes_tui/app.py::action_template_note()`

**Test:**
```bash
./venv/bin/notes-tui
# Press 'N' (Shift+n)
# Select template from list
# Type: "meeting-notes-2025-10-25"
# Editor opens with template structure
```

---

### 3. Daily Journal (`j` key)
**User Story:** "I want instant access to today's journal with zero friction"

**Implementation:**
- Press `j` → Today's journal opens immediately
- Auto-creates journal if it doesn't exist
- Uses `daily_journal.md` template if available
- Creates in `journals/` directory
- File named: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-10-25.md`)
- Zero prompts, instant access

**Code Location:** `notes_tui/app.py::action_quick_journal()`

**Test:**
```bash
./venv/bin/notes-tui
# Press 'j'
# Editor opens with today's journal
# Write your entry
# Save and exit
```

---

### 4. Edit Selected Note (`e` key)
**User Story:** "I want to edit notes I'm viewing in the tree"

**Implementation:**
- Navigate to note in tree view
- Press `e` → Opens in editor
- Returns to TUI after editing
- Preview refreshes automatically
- Tree view updates if needed

**Code Location:** `notes_tui/app.py::action_edit_note()`

**Test:**
```bash
./venv/bin/notes-tui
# Navigate to a note with arrow keys
# Press Enter to preview
# Press 'e' to edit
# Make changes in editor
# Save and exit
# Preview shows updated content
```

---

### 5. Helper Method: `_open_in_editor()`
**Purpose:** Centralized editor launching with UI refresh

**Features:**
- Suspends TUI during editing
- Launches configured editor
- Blocks until editor closes
- Refreshes tree view on return
- Updates preview pane
- Shows status messages
- Handles errors gracefully

**Code Location:** `notes_tui/app.py::_open_in_editor()`

**Used By:**
- Quick note creation (`n`)
- Template note creation (`N`)
- Daily journal (`j`)
- Edit selected (`e`)

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS

### None Currently Identified ✅

All Phase 2 features working as designed.

---

## 📝 CONFIGURATION

### Required Config Settings
Located in `config/default.yaml`:

```yaml
quick_capture:
  instant_edit: true  # Auto-open editor after creation
  default_category: "personal"  # Where quick notes go
  default_template: "general_note.md"  # Template for 'n' key

editor:
  default: "nano"  # Or vim, nvim, etc.
  alternatives:
    - "nvim"
    - "vim"
    - "vi"
```

### Template Requirements
For best experience, ensure these templates exist in `.templates/`:
- `general_note.md` - For quick notes (`n` key)
- `daily_journal.md` - For journals (`j` key)

**Fallback:** If templates missing, creates blank file
